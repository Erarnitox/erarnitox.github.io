### Guided Hacking
Guided Hacking is in my eyes still the best place on the web to learn Game Hacking.
The value of this site really comes from the structured learning path they provide.
However, you will also get access to a lot of source code and tools that are exclusive
for members.

### Crypto.com
Crypto.com is a broker for crypto currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum and many more.
The cool think I like about Crypto.com is that it has a simple app layout, good support most importantly:
It is very easy to send the crypto currencies you buy to your own crypto wallet.
No matter if its a soft or hardware wallet.

### Scalable.captial
If you are from Germany and want to get started investing you can use scalable.captial
as a cheap and easy to use neobroker. They list many ETF Products and Stocks.

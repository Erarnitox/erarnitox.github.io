<p>I don’t like donations, but if you want to spend a bit of money, here
are some things you might like. On every sign up through the following
links I will earn a commission. However, I will only list services here
that I use myself and genuenly like.</p>
<h3 id="guided-hacking">Guided Hacking</h3>
<p>Guided Hacking is in my eyes still the best place on the web to learn
Game Hacking. The value of this site really comes from the structured
learning path they provide. However, you will also get access to a lot
of source code and tools that are exclusive for members.</p>
<p>Sign up: <a

<h3 id="crypto.com">Crypto.com</h3>
<p>Crypto.com is a broker for crypto currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum
and many more. The cool think I like about Crypto.com is that it has a
simple app layout, good support most importantly: It is very easy to
send the crypto currencies you buy to your own crypto wallet. No matter
if its a soft or hardware wallet.</p>
<p>Sign up: <a href="https://crypto.com/app/42d7gmtc4g">Here</a></p>
<h3 id="scalable.captial">Scalable.captial</h3>
<p>If you are from Germany and want to get started investing you can use
scalable.captial as a cheap and easy to use neobroker. They list many
ETF Products and Stocks. The App is also simple to use. I don’t regret
having decided on this broker app.</p>

<hr />
<p>Let’s dive into the story of my very first game. Well, “first game”
isn’t entirely true; I had dabbled with some incredibly simple games
before starting PlanB. But, to be honest, my programming experience was
pretty limited back then.</p>
<h2 id="the-spark-of-motivation">The Spark of Motivation</h2>
<p>So, what pushed me into the world of game development? Simply put, I
was a huge fan of shooter games. At the time, my two absolute favorites
were <strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops</strong> and <strong>Cube 2:
Sauerbraten</strong>.</p>
<p>I was always curious about how I could create my own maps and weapons
for these games.</p>
<h2 id="a-trip-down-memory-lane">A Trip Down Memory Lane</h2>
<p>I knew Sauerbraten was open-source, and after a lot of wrestling with
‘Make,’ I even managed to compile it myself. However, I quickly realized
I was in over my head trying to understand its source code. My
programming skills, limited to AutoIt and BASIC, just weren’t up to the
task. So, I put C++ and my attempts to modify the game on the back
burner.</p>
<p>After a while, I stumbled upon some developers on YouTube who were
using the <strong>Unity3D</strong> game engine. A few of the early
pioneers who inspired me were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OneManArmy3d:</strong> He was working on an FPS kit and used
Call of Duty models for his video previews.</li>
<li><strong>DrunkenLizardGames:</strong> This developer was creating an
FPS with a seriously cool animation system and parkour elements.</li>
<li><strong>TheLegoBobafet:</strong> He was working on an untitled FPS
at the time, which has since been released as “Red Army.”</li>
</ul>
<p>These creators were the reason I decided to give Unity3D a shot, back
when it was in version 3-something. For a good while, all I did was mess
around with the bootcamp and the island FPS demo. Eventually, I joined
OneManArmy’s forum, armedunity.com, and started using his FPS kit to
learn and experiment.</p>
<p>There were also some fantastic YouTubers creating coding tutorials
that were perfect for a beginner like me. The most notable were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NarutoIsGreat12345:</strong> Now known as
HyperShadeTutorials. Sadly, the old content is gone.</li>
<li><strong>Eetski Tutorials:</strong> Now known as MasterIndie on
YouTube.</li>
</ul>
<p>But I truly learned the most from the ArmedUnity community (which, by
the way, stands for “armed with unity”). The community was filled with
amazing people, too many to name them all. However, a special shout-out
goes to <strong>OcularCash</strong>, who helped me out directly a few
times.</p>
<p>I also have to mention <strong>theMars2011</strong>, who joined the
forum a bit later than me but is now working on a really impressive
title with a small team.</p>

<h2 id="the-development-of-planb">The Development of PlanB</h2>
<p>After building a solid foundation and understanding the theory behind
creating an FPS, I finally felt ready to build my own from scratch. The
structure was heavily inspired by OMA’s FPS Kit and guides from the
community, but I was determined to create most of it myself.</p>
<p>Without much planning, I dove straight into coding the character
controller, weapon scripts, and even started modeling and animating the
weapons. I think I managed to get all of this done in a single week
before I uploaded this video:</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f8ZaMEcxTbc?si=BS1AUgvyumv55h35" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
<p>Initially, I wanted PlanB to be a story-based multiplayer FPS—a
SciFi-WW2 shooter, to be exact. I had even modeled some weapons for
it.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../../res/mp40_final.png" alt="Image: MP40 Weapon Model" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Image: MP40 Weapon Model</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As you can probably guess, it was a strange idea. Realizing it didn’t
make much sense, I scrapped the entire story and all the models.
Instead, I decided to create a simple multiplayer game set in a
completely fictional world.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../../res/Helmet.png" alt="Image: Helmet Model" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Image: Helmet Model</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I ended up ditching all of the previous player and weapon models and
decided to design my own using Krita and Gimp. Here are some of the
designs I came up with:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../../res/Designs.png" alt="Image: Weapon Designs" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Image: Weapon Designs</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After designing, modeling, texturing, and recording sounds for the
weapons, I settled on a set of 10. (About 5 weapon designs got scrapped
along the way.)</p>
<p>Here’s a video showcasing all the weapons with their sounds in the
game:</p>

</iframe>
<p>I wanted to focus on the gameplay first, so I implemented a simple
zombie AI that would chase and attack the player. I also needed an easy
way to save settings, progress, and other data. The existing tools felt
lacking, so I created my own simple key-value store solution with some
custom editor scripts.</p>
<p>You can check out the tool I developed for saving the game here:</p>
<p><a

XenoPrefs</a></p>
<p>Around this time, I also added a class editor to the game, allowing
players to create “classes” with their preferred weapons, skins, and
perks.</p>
<p>After polishing most of the basic functionality, I made this
video:</p>

<h2 id="procedural-generation-adventures">Procedural Generation
Adventures</h2>
<p>I had this idea of creating a vast, Fallout-style wasteland for a
map. To save time on level design, I decided to go with procedural
generation. This meant:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatically generating textures and terrain materials.</li>
<li>Automatically generating terrain height maps.</li>
<li>Automatically applying vegetation and textures to the map.</li>
<li>Automatically building a border around the terrain and placing
prefabs like buildings.</li>
</ul>
<p>First, I needed a tool to help me create seamless PBR materials. I
ended up writing a simple Java tool that uses some clever tricks to
produce some pretty nice results.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yUWNrMGyGKs?si=kw6CRK0O6hWwtMIa" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
<p>I took a trip to the woods with my camera and snapped photos of
textures. Then, I wrote a basic terrain generation script that created a
height map by layering Perlin noise with different frequencies and
amplitudes.</p>
<p>I wanted a bigger terrain than what Unity supports by default, but
there was an easy fix: stitching multiple terrains together. By using
the size of the terrain and an offset for the Perlin noise function, I
could make the terrains stitch together perfectly.</p>
<p>But it still wasn’t enough. The tiling on the terrain was too
obvious. So, I decided to write a custom terrain shader with harder
blending between textures and a few cheap tricks to hide the tiling.
This included overlaying a Perlin noise texture to control the hue and
blending with a larger version of the same terrain texture based on the
camera’s distance.</p>
<p>This meant that up close, you’d see the detailed, scaled-down version
of the texture. But from a distance, the scaled-up version would become
more opaque, hiding the seams and patterns.</p>
<p>The last step was to correct the normals of the vertices at the edges
of the stitched terrains. Without neighboring vertices to calculate the
correct orientation, these edges were creating a noticeable seam.</p>
<p>After solving this issue, the generated terrain looked like this:</p>
<p>Note that the buildings, trees, and other vegetation were also
procedurally placed in logical locations.</p>
<p>This tool is also open-source, and you can get it for
<strong>free</strong> here:</p>
<p><a
href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/terrain/xenosandboxgenerator-132459">Download
XenoSandboxGenerator</a></p>
<p>However, after a while, I realized that while I could generate huge
maps with this tool, they were ultimately boring to play on.</p>
<p>So, I decided to build a map manually with the help of the Unity
Asset Store and a friend. We ended up with this map:</p>
<p>This is the map currently used in the game. The only things left to
do were to enable server configuration through a <code>.conf</code> file
and remove the claymore mines.</p>
<p>These things were buggy, useless, and annoying in multiplayer, so I
just got rid of them.</p>

<p>In the end, PlanB turned out to be a really fun game for LAN parties.
It’s available for Windows, Mac, and Linux here:</p>

<p>I’ve discontinued the official server, but it’s really easy to host
your own, as described on the download page. I hope you can try it out
and enjoy the game with some friends!</p>
<h3 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h3>
<p>Even though this game didn’t turn out to be the next Call of Duty, as
my younger self had hoped, it became a fun shooter to play at LAN
parties. More importantly, the real value of this project lies in
everything I learned along the way.</p>
<p>This includes but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to program in general</li>
<li>Using modeling software like blender</li>
<li>How game engines work</li>
<li>introduction to shader programming</li>
